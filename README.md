## Scenario
Medical diagnosis. Some medical researchers have created a Bayesian network that models the
inter-relationship between (some) diseases and observed symptoms. Our job as computer scientists is to
learn parameters for the network based on health records. Unfortunately, as it happens in the real world,
certain records have missing values. We need to do our best to compute the parameters for the network,
so that it can be used for diagnosis later on.
